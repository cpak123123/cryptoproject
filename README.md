# cryptoproject
Working with APIs, frontend (Dash), visualizations, and a dash of data science to learn about crypto, and present it in a beginner friendly format
Hey there!
First project on Github, so any comments, recommendations, and criticisms, please message me.

To run this project, run dashboard.py via python, and open the address on your local browser.
As of now, it is a very simple dashboard, but I plan to add more and more layers as I continue to learn more frameworks and such.
